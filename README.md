# 2D Shape Plotter Application in C++

## Overview

This C++ application allows users to create and visualize 2D shapes, including Point, Line, Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, and Polygon. Users can choose the shape they want to draw and input the necessary coordinates. The application generates a `.dat` file that can be visualized using Gnuplot.

## Features

- Supports various 2D shapes: Point, Line, Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Polygon
- Interactive user input for shape selection and coordinates
- Generates a `.dat` file for visualization with Gnuplot

## Classes

- **Point**: Represents a point in 2D space.
- **Line**: Represents a line segment defined by two points.
- **Square**: Represents a square defined by one corner and its side length.
- **Rectangle**: Represents a rectangle defined by two opposite corners.
- **Triangle**: Represents a triangle defined by three vertices.
- **Circle**: Represents a circle defined by a center point and radius.
- **Polygon**: Represents a polygon defined by multiple vertices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Gnuplot for visualizing the generated `.dat` files

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-shape-drawing.git
   cd 2D Shape Plotter
